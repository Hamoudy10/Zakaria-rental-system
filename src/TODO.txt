🎯 Implementation Plan for Agent Dashboard:
Phase 1: Create Tenant Management Interface
New component: TenantManagement.jsx

Features:

List tenants with search/filter

Add tenant form with validation

Edit tenant details

Deactivate tenants (soft delete)

API endpoints needed: /api/tenants/*

Phase 2: Enhanced SMS Management
Extend existing SendNotifications.jsx or create SMSManagement.jsx

Features:

View failed SMS queue

Retry individual/bulk SMS

Manual trigger for billing SMS

Send custom notifications

API endpoints: /api/cron/failed-sms, /api/cron/retry-sms/*, /api/cron/trigger-billing

Phase 3: Water Bill SMS Integration
Update AgentWaterBills.jsx

Features:

Add "Send SMS" button after saving water bills

Option to trigger billing SMS for all tenants

Preview SMS before sending

🔧 Recommended Implementation Order:
Week 1: Tenant Management

Create CRUD interface for tenants

Add to AgentDashboard tabs

Week 2: SMS Management

Create SMS queue viewer

Add retry functionality

Add manual billing trigger

Week 3: Water Bill Integration

Add SMS trigger to water bills

Test complete workflow

📊 Database Updates Needed:
Based on the conversation, the database already has:

✅ sms_queue table for failed SMS

✅ billing_runs table for audit logs

✅ tenants table with all required fields

✅ water_bills table for water bill tracking

🚀 Immediate Next Steps:
Let me know which part you want to implement first. I recommend starting with Tenant Management since it's a standalone feature that doesn't depend on other components.

Would you like me to:

Create the TenantManagement.jsx component with CRUD operations?

Create the SMSManagement.jsx component for manual SMS handling?

Update AgentWaterBills.jsx to add SMS trigger?

Recommendation: Start with Tenant Management as it's foundational and will be used by other features.

Shall I proceed with creating the Tenant Management component first?
